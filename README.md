# Pygma

**Pygma** is a LatAm based accelerator for early-stage founders, we help pre-seed founders build better tech companies by co-building tech companies and helping them raise capital.

Pygma is a merger from a product driven incubator in the Netherlands, and Acanof a data-driven accelerator from LatAm. We are now excited to acquire Scala a pre-seed fund from Colombia to help us build our vision around venture capital for the Latin America region.
